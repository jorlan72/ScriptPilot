11.06.2023 - Build 1.0.0.293
Added two new commands : LoadVariable and SaveVariable
Saves or loads variables using text files.

In this way, without internal multithreading, the operating system can handle all the threading and the app can do multiple scripts at the same time.
Added global variable #DataSourceIndex#
